### Disclaimer

I have Sitecore 8 binaries added as an internal NuGet package. As you know, I cannot distribute these binaries, so please make sure to add the appropriate DLLs to these projects before compiling.

Each project has its own README outlining the necessary libraries to include which can be found in its related disclaimer section.
