Assorted Scripts
================

### Summary

This repository houses an assortment of scripts I've written for Sitecore. To be clear, I've used them but won't provide the "Stamp of approval" for production. Still, I feel it could be useful to others to share these assets.

### Included Files

* Install-Sitecore.ps1  
  Simple powershell that creates a Sitecore instance (website) from an archive.

> That's not to say I wouldn't accept pull requests/feedback, just please do not assume you can directly dump these into a CI setting and have them work.
